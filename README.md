# #BuildForSDG Cohort-1 JavaScript Assessment

> Build an overly simplified COVID-19 infection impact estimator

This assessment empowers you to **attempt** helping society and leaders prepare for the **real rig problem** of COVID-19, which is **its impact on lives, our health systems, and the economy**: 
> 1.  Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks and other PPE if *we don’t practice extreme social distancing*.
> 2.  Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production of essentials like food, from too many being sick or people caring for their sick loved ones. 

You will do this by building a **novelty** COVID-19 infections ~~predictor~~ estimator following the project setup and submission process outlined below:

## Project Setup & Submission Process

1.  You are to clone the [covid-19-estimator-js repo](https://github.com/BuildforSDG-Cohort1-Assessment/covid-19-estimator-js) by clicking on the **`use this template`** button. Do not use the `clone`, `download`, or `fork` button. During the cloning process, feel free to give your repo a name of your choice but make sure it is left as a  **public** repository. Changing it to be a private repo will break your setup for this assessment.

2. Go ahead and clone your repo into your developer machine, cd into the repo and run `yarn install`

3.  To work on the assessment [fully documented here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRdz22WafCadi-wx3e2FP-xzKe69z_sL/view), write your code for each challenges in a new git branch. **DO NOT WRITE YOUR CODE IN THE MASTER BRANCH**, because you won't be able to submit your work for that challenge.

4.  To submit your work for a given challenge, do the following: 
    -   on your machine, make sure you are in the branch that has the code for the said challenge.
    -   commit your changes and push them online to your repository.
    -   go to your repository on GitHub and raise a Pull Request from the branch of the particular challenge, to the master branch. -   Wait to make sure the automated checks and code review for the challenge run and either pass or fail. Only proceed to merege your changes to the master branch if they pass.
    -   Going ahead to merge into the master branch before the checks run or before they complete (by passing or failing), is the equivalent of not submitting your work for that challenge, in which case you might need to raise a new pull request or update the exiting one.


> Yes, the virus only kills a small percentage of those afflicted. Yes, the flu kills 10s of thousands of people annually. Yes, 80% of people will experience lightweight symptoms with COVID19. Yes the mortality rate of COVID19 is relatively low (1–2%). All of this true, but is immaterial. They are the wrong numbers to focus on…
